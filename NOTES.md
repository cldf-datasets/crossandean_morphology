This dataset aims to provide a complete collection of Quechua morphology. Until now, we gathered data from 23 varieties of the family from a variety of published sources as well as individual contributions. All forms have been converted to IPA and segmentated to enable further processing for both traditional and computational research. The phonetic representation is not based on our own judgements, but rather adheres to the original author's indications of pronounciation. We greatly appreciate any improvement on gaps in our dataset as well as additional phonological information. If you want to contribute, feel free to contact us.

Furthermore, this dataset is part of a research project which searches to re-evaluate the internal classification of Quechua with phylolinguistic methods. A first talk on that topic will be presented in September 2021 at REELA, TÃ¼bingen.
